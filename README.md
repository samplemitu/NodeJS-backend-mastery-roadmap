## 🧠 My Mastery Tags (For GitHub & Recruiter Search)

These are the skills and topics I’m actively mastering and documenting in this repo. They also help recruiters and devs find my work through GitHub search and external engines.

`nodejs`, `backend`, `debugging`, `performance`, `express`, `fastify`, `api`, `architecture`, `system design`, `memory leaks`, `event loop`, `streams`, `async`, `testing`, `security`, `observability`, `redis`, `postgres`, `mongodb`, `jwt`, `rate limiting`, `open source`, `bug fixing`, `production`, `ci/cd`, `logging`, `profiling`, `clustering`, `worker threads`, `nodejs mastery`

## 🧠 Core Modules Mastery

- `fs`: handled file read concurrency bugs
- `path`: debugged cross-platform path issues
- `events`: fixed listener leaks and memory pressure
- `stream`: managed backpressure and error events
- `http`: traced request lifecycle and response hangs

Tools used: `node --inspect`, `console.trace`, `DEBUG=*`

---

## ⚙️ Async Internals & Error Handling

- Event loop phases, microtasks vs macrotasks
- Promises, callbacks, async/await bugs
- Patterns: `try/catch`, `safe(fn)`, `process.on('unhandledRejection')`

---

## 🌐 HTTP Servers & Middleware

- Express/Fastify internals, middleware chaining
- REST API architecture, validation, JWT auth
- Real bugs: CORS errors, route shadowing, missing `res.send`

---

## 🗄️ Databases & Caching

- Postgres, MongoDB, Redis
- Connection pooling, indexing, cache invalidation
- Performance profiling with `clinic.js`

---

## 🧪 Testing, CI & Security

- Jest, Supertest, GitHub Actions
- OWASP Top 10, helmet, rate limiting
- Logging with Pino/Winston, graceful shutdown

---

## 🔬 Advanced Node.js

- Streams, backpressure, custom pipelines
- Worker threads, clustering, message queues
- Memory profiling, heap snapshots
